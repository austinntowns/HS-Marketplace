## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Lead capture only (no transaction handling) — reduces Phase 2 scope significantly
- Authenticated access only — means auth is a hard blocker for every feature
- Corporate moderation required — admin approval queue is mandatory before any listing goes live
- Next.js + Neon + Vercel — stack confirmed, use Auth.js v5 with hd restriction for Google Workspace SSO

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hello Sugar internal API contract is unknown (endpoint shape, auth, rate limits, KPI fields) — Phase 4 requires a discovery spike before work can be scoped; proxy layer should accept a mock during Phases 1-3
- Hello Sugar Workspace domain name needs confirmation (assumed hellosugar.salon — verify before writing auth config)
- Photo storage provider not decided (Vercel Blob vs Cloudinary) — decision needed before Phase 2 listing form work
